// National (significant) Number is defined in International Telecommunication Union Recommendation
// E.164. It is a language/country-neutral representation of a phone number at a country level. For
// countries which have the concept of Area Code, the National (significant) Number contains the
// area code. It contains a maximum number of digits which equal to 15 - n, where n is the number of
// digits of the country code. Take note that National (significant) Number does not contain
// National(trunk) prefix. Obviously, as a uint64, it will never contain any formatting (hypens,
// spaces, parentheses), nor any alphanumeric spellings.
  required uint64 national_number = 2;

// Extension is not standardized in ITU recommendations, except for being defined as a series of
// numbers with a maximum length of 40 digits. It is defined as a string here to accommodate for the
// possible use of a leading zero in the extension (organizations have complete freedom to do so,
// as there is no standard defined). However, only ASCII digits should be stored here.

// The leading zero in the national (significant) number of an Italian phone number has a special
// meaning. Unlike the rest of the world, it indicates the number is a fixed-line number. There have
// been plans to migrate fixed-line numbers to start with the digit two since December 2000, but it
// has not happened yet. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2B39 for more details.
//
// This field can be safely ignored (no need to set it) if you are not dealing with Italian
// phone numbers. For an Italian phone number, if its national (significant) number starts
// with the digit zero, set this flag to true.
